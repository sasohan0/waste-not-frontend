          COVID-19 has put a lot of companies, big and small, out of business.
          The lockdowns across the world have forced people to stay indoors, and
          for a lot of offline businesses, this meant that footfall across their
          shops has gone down. Obviously, this also completely shut a lot of
          businesses.{" "}

        <p className="m-2 p-2">
          The pandemic has been especially bad for small and medium-sized
          businesses. These companies usually work with limited capital and
          don’t have enough liquidity to stay afloat without business for long
          durations. However, some businesses have managed to not just survive
          but grow and expand. Most of these success stories have been fueled by
          doing business in the digital marketplace.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="m-2 p-2">
          A lot of people have also started small-scale, home-based businesses
          to make up for lost incomes. And even here, the businesses that have
          done the best are businesses that have gone online and leveraged the
          online markets.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="m-2 p-2">
          So, if you have a home-based business, it makes sense to take it
          online and open it up for a larger and wider audience. Being online
          gives you access to a much bigger market and can help your business
          grow. Additionally, with people staying indoors, the majority of
          transactions have moved to the internet, and more people are shopping
          online today than ever before.{" "}

          With that in the background, this article aims to help you understand

          A domain name is essentially the address of your website. For example,
          ‘<em>yourwebsite.com</em>’ is your domain name. It is also the first
          introduction of your brand to your potential customers. So, make sure
          that your<strong> </strong>domain name conveys what you do, or who you
          are. There are — this is an oversimplification, of course — two routes
          here. You can either{" "}

        </h3>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Your website, like your business itself, has to ‘reside’ somewhere.
          Web hosting companies do this for you. Web hosting companies have web
          servers on which your website data is stored, and when someone
          accesses your website, it is these servers that will cater to those
          requests.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Partnering with a<strong> </strong>good web hosting company is
          crucial, to say the least. You want your web hosting company to offer
          secure, fast, and reliable hosting. Cyberattacks are on the rise,
          people don’t like slow websites, and if your website crashes often and
          isn’t reliable, it’ll hurt your SEO rankings and search engines won’t
          show your website. So, it’s very important that you{" "}

        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Before you go ahead and create your website, think of what you want it
          to do. Do you want a simple website that just allows people to know
          who you are? Or do you want people to purchase something off your
          website? Or are you looking to have a comprehensive digital presence
          with lots of content on your website and regular blog and video
          uploads?
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          These are questions that you will have to answer because these answers
          will ultimately dictate what your website looks like and what hosting
          plans you will need.

          <strong>4. Choose a hosting plan</strong>
        </h3>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          A hosting plan is a bit like a Netflix subscription. Your web hosting
          company provides the hosting service and you pay a monthly (can be
          yearly or quarterly too) fee to them. There are different types of
          hosting platforms through which a website can be hosted. Shared
          Hosting, VPS Hosting, and Dedicated Hosting are some of the popular
          methods.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Prices and features vary. However, here’s a word of advice: If you’re
          going to do very little with your website and you’re looking at a very
          simple design and low traffic, Shared Hosting is more than enough. A
          business website with plenty of financial transactions will need a VPS
          Hosting plan. You don’t have to worry about Dedicated Hosting for
          now.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Do your homework, understand your website needs and different hosting
          types before selecting a plan.&nbsp;

            Building or designing a website

          has become very easy over the years. If you know how to work a
          computer, you can probably build your website. There are hundreds of
          tools that offer thousands of templates. You just pick a template and
          fill in the details — it’s that simple.&nbsp;

        <p></p>
        <p>
          However, if you don’t want an existing template, or if you want to
          make a lot of changes to an existing template, you should be hiring a
          web developer or a web designer. They are professionals who will help
          you with building your website exactly the way you have
          envisioned.&nbsp;

          Once your website is up and running, ensure that you tell as many
          people about it as possible. Inform all your offline customers about
          your website and request them to pass on the information too.&nbsp;

          It’s also important to understand that your business is now an online
          business, meaning there are a few different rules that you need to
          know. First off, higher traffic leads to better business. So, try to
          drive as much traffic as you can.&nbsp;
